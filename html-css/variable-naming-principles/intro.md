PatternFly Core is based on the principles of [Atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) and BEM (Block, Element, Modifier).

[BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) is a popular CSS methodology for building modular, scalable applications. It provides scope, avoids inheritance, and reduces CSS specificity and conflicts.

BEM works perfectly with a modular design system, as each unique component can be represented as an independent block. Since a block is tied to a component, developers are able to develop, move around, and nest components without conflicts in their applicationâ€™s CSS.

PatternFly uses a modified version of BEM for its CSS architecture. Where PatternFly deviates from BEM is in relation to modifiers.

This module covers how PatternFly uses BEM as a framework for its component library. You'll learn how to override and create both global and component-level custom properties and component elements.

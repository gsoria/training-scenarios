In PatternFly, layouts are the containers that allow for organizing and grouping elements. Instead of writing CSS, use layouts. They allow components to remain modular by handling the styles necessary to position components in different contexts. Note that layout styles should never be part of a component.

This module covers PatternFly's several different layouts: bullseye, flex, gallery, grid, level, split, and stack.
